# CIRCLE: Continual Repair across Programming Languages

## File Structure

- Bugs_fixed: This folder includes all the bugs in all the benchmarks that CIRCLE fixed. Each file contains the buggy line, CIECLE's patch and the developer's patch
- Candidate_patches: This folder includes all the candidate patches CIECLE generated for the given bugs.

## Note

Now we release the correct patches only for Defects4J, as for other benchmarks, we perform exact match to calculate number of correct patches, which means the patches are identical to the ground truth ones.

More detailed information and the source code will be released after the double-blind review.
